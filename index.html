      <h4>Project disbanded temporarily</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Due to recent action by a team member, Barcode, skidding with ChatGPT-generated code and announcements, as well
        as being manipulative and stealing the Discord support server, Bluely has been temporarily shut down. He doxxed
        a 13 year old (monkxy) and the poor guy was the only person to like the paste.</p>
      <div style="width: 90%; height: 2px; background-color: white; border-radius: 2rem; margin: 10px !important;">
      </div>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">Thank you for your continued support and we hope to see you soon.</p>
      <p>The bot's code is still owned by me fully. It will be rehosted shortly. He only took the email addresses.</p>
      <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 10px;">~ monkey</p>

      <p>So fucked up he doxxed monkey (who is 13) after getting demolished in the entire Blooket community for being an ass coder and skidder.</p>
      <p>Claims to be able to program in over 30 languages but fails to find out how to run a simple verification bot.</p>
      <p>"Owns 15k in BTC" (but lives in the slums) and pays $20 to each of his 13 year old camgirls livestreaming themselves flicking their beans on Discord.</p>
      <p>Says he was a former Doxbin staff member (untrue and nobody knows him from the staff team), submitted Nvidia drivers to fix a bug (somehow not fixed?) and lies about everything.</p>
      <p>Tried to hit off Blacket but failed to down Susdog's 1 gigabit weak home internet connection.</p>
      <p>Has no real friends, no real love life, and now, no real Discord!</p>
